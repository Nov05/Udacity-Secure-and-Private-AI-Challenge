Welcome to the Secure & Private AI Scholarship Challenge! We'd like to share some important details with you about how to get started in the classroom and connect with your community.

Your course runs from **May 30, 2019 - Aug 30, 2019**. Here's a checklist to get started:

- **Start Learning.** Go to your classroom and click on the Secure & Private AI Scholarship Challenge course card. Make sure you're logged into your Udacity account with your email address. If you have taken several Udacity courses before, your course card may not appear on the first page of your classroom - it will instead be found on a subsequent classroom page.

- **Join the [Secure & Private AI Challenge Slack Channel](https://slackin.udacity.com/secureprivateaischolar).** Interact with your scholarship classmates and community manager. Ask questions, support your classmates, and engage with the scholarship community.

- **[Join a developer Circle](https://developers.facebook.com/developercircles)** to stay updated on the latest Secure & Private AI news, product updates, meetups, etc.

- **[Attend Orientation Webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmyE4zjRJnI) on June 3rd (11:30 am GMT).** Meet the Udacity team and get the information you need to dive into the program. We will be recording this session and posting in the [Slack Community](https://secureprivataischolar.slack.com/) so you can access it at your own convenience.

- **[Check out the Secure & Private AI Scholarship Challenge Site](https://sites.google.com/udacity.com/secureprivateai-challenge/)** to access program resources and announcements.
If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to us at scholarships-support@udacity.com. We will be here right alongside you on your learning journey.
