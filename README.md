## Challenge Content

**Phase 1: Secure and Private AI Scholarship Challenge**  
In the first phase, you’ll have 3 months to complete this challenge course. You'll need to embrace a steady learning routine in order to successfully complete the course by the deadline. In addition to watching the videos and completing the assessments in the classroom, you will also be invited to join the Secure and Private AI Challenge Learning Community, a private Slack community, where you can connect with your peers and coaches in the program, share your progress, get feedback, and ask questions. You'll find out how to join the Slack community later in this lesson.

**Phase 2: Deep Learning or Computer Vision Nanodegree Scholarship Opportunity**  
You have the chance to qualify for a follow-up scholarship for a Nanodegree program. These scholarships will be awarded based on your progress and performance in the initial 3-month challenge course, as well as your contributions to the student community. So, be sure to cover all the concepts in the course, complete all exercises along the way, and help your fellow students by answering their questions in Slack. (P.S. Given the PyTorch Challenge experience, thousands challengers would qualify for Phase II, but usually only 300 challengers would be admitted to Phase II, so mostly it would depend on a challenger's luck.)

## Course Outline  

### 1. Welcome to the Scholarship Challenge  
Phase 1: Secure and Private AI Scholarship Challenge (3 months)  
Phase 2: Deep Learning or Computer Vision Nanodegree Scholarship Opportunity  

### 2. Deep Learning with PyTorch    
Learn the concepts behind deep learning and how we train deep neural networks with backpropagation.  

### 3. Introducing Differential Privacy  
In this lesson, you will learn about the basics of differential privacy, a method of measuring how operations impact the the privacy of data.
