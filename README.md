## Challenge Content

**Phase 1: Secure and Private AI Scholarship Challenge**  
In the first phase, youâ€™ll have 3 months to complete this challenge course. You'll need to embrace a steady learning routine in order to successfully complete the course by the deadline. In addition to watching the videos and completing the assessments in the classroom, you will also be invited to join the Secure and Private AI Challenge Learning Community, a private Slack community, where you can connect with your peers and coaches in the program, share your progress, get feedback, and ask questions. You'll find out how to join the Slack community later in this lesson.

**Phase 2: Deep Learning or Computer Vision Nanodegree Scholarship Opportunity** 
You have the chance to qualify for a follow-up scholarship for a Nanodegree program. These scholarships will be awarded based on your progress and performance in the initial 3-month challenge course (mostly luck), as well as your contributions to the student community (luck again). So, be sure to cover all the concepts in the course, complete all exercises along the way, and help your fellow students by answering their questions in Slack.

## Course Outline  
In this course, you'll learn the basics of deep neural networks and how to build various models using PyTorch. You'll get hands-on experience building state-of-the-art deep learning models.
