Hi there, I'm Mat!  

Welcome!  

Hi there and welcome to this course on secure and private AI. I'm Mat Leonard, the head of Udacity's School of AI. We worked with Andrew Trask, the lead of OpenMined.org and researcher at DeepMind, to bring you this course on privacy-preserving AI. I'm thrilled that you're here because this is one of the most exciting courses I've worked on at Udacity. I believe the technology you'll learn here is the future of AI.  

The content in this course requires that you are comfortable using PyTorch, a Python library for building deep learning models and other machine learning algorithms. For those who haven't used PyTorch before, we've included this lesson (taught by me!) to prepare you for the rest of the course. In the lesson, I cover basic operations like matrix multiplication all the way to building state-of-the-art image classifiers.  

Thanks for enrolling in this course and I hope you enjoy what you learn!
