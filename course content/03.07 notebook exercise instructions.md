###Instructions for launching the exercise notebook

For this project, you'll need to get the notebooks from https://github.com/udacity/private-ai. Clone the repo, install the required libraries, and work through the notebook `Section 1 - Differential Privacy.ipynb`. For support in the projects (both installation and questions you may have), join the Slack group at "slack.openmined.org". You may put your questions in the #beginner channel.

The easiest way to install the required libraries is with Conda. Create a new environment, then install the dependencies in that environment. In your terminal:
```
conda create -n pysyft python=3
conda activate pysyft # some older version of conda require "source activate pysyft" instead.
conda install jupyter notebook
pip install syft
pip install numpy```

If you have any errors relating to zstd - run the following (if everything above installed fine then skip this step):

`pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall zstd`  

and then retry installing syft (pip install syft). If this still doesn't work, and you happen to be on OSX, make sure you have [OSX command line tools](https://railsapps.github.io/xcode-command-line-tools.html) installed and try again.

If you are using Windows, I suggest installing Anaconda and using the Anaconda Prompt to work from the command line.

With this environment activated and in the repo directory, launch Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook
